## UX Review

1) Clarity & Promise
- Hero clearly states value: “Three date options in 30 seconds.” Primary CTA present (Deal me 3).

2) Decision Speed
- Defaults are sensible (Tonight, low-key). Budget inputs visible; date defaults to +14d.
- Travel time communicated in itineraries ("hop Xm").

3) Consistency
- Buttons and chips follow consistent styles; 8pt-ish spacing holds across sections.

4) Feedback
- Toasts on copy/review submit; empty state on London browse; modal contains Clear CTAs.

5) Mobile
- Sticky filter bar present; controls are large enough; safe for thumb reach.

6) Content
- “Why it works” blurbs present; price shows both band and level; lead-time note included.

7) Trust
- Reviews surfaced with average and count; submission persists locally.

8) Shareability
- Clean URLs on browse; plan can be copied. Consider WhatsApp share in a follow-up.

9) Pitfalls
- Watch for filter discoverability on desktop; consider a hint near the grid. No CLS noticed in static render.
